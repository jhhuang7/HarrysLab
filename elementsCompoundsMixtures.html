						It is now understood that all atoms are made up of small particles. The amount of negative charge carried by each electron is the same as the amount of positive charge carried by each proton. In an atom, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons, so there is no overall electric charge.
					</p>
					<p>
						The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. Each element has a different atomic number. As the early scientists discovered more and more elements, it became more important that they all agreed on what to call them. Each element was given a name and a chemical symbol. The chemical symbols of most elements are very easy to understand. The symbol sometimes starts with the capital letter that is the first letter of the element’s name.

					<p>
						All substances can be placed into one of three groups: elements, compounds or mixtures.
					</p>
					<p>
						Elements are substances that contain only one type of atom. Very few substances exist as elements. Most substances around us are either compounds or mixtures.
					</p>
					<p>
						Compounds are usually very different from the elements of which they are made. In compounds, the atoms of one element are bonded very tightly to the atoms of another element or elements. The elements that make up a compound are completely different substances from the compound. For example, pure salt (sodium chloride) is a compound made up of the elements sodium (a silvery metal) and chlorine (a green, poisonous gas).
					</p>
					<p>
						Mixtures can be made up of two or more elements, two or more compounds or a combination of elements and compounds. The substances that make up mixtures can usually be easily separated from each other. When the parts of a mixture are separated, no new substances are formed. Fizzy soft drink is a good example of a mixture. If you shake the soft drink, the gas bubbles separate from the water and go into the air. You still have the water in the bottle and the gas in the air.

					<h2>Metals</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							They are solid at room temperature, except for mercury, which is a liquid.
						</li>
						<li>
							They can be polished to produce a high shine or lustre.
						</li>
						<li>
							They are good conductors of electricity and heat.
						</li>
						<li>
							They can all be beaten or bent into a variety of shapes. We say they are malleable.
						</li>
						<li>
							They can be made into a wire. We say they are ductile.
						</li>
						<li>
							They usually melt at high temperatures. Mercury, which melts at –40°C, is one exception.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</aside>

				<aside>
					<h2>Non-metals</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							They cannot be polished to give a shine like metals; they are usually dull or glassy.
						</li>
						<li>
							They are brittle, which means they shatter when they are hit.
						</li>
						<li>
							They cannot be bent into shape.
						</li>
						<li>
							They are usually poor conductors of electricity and heat.
						</li>
						<li>
							They usually melt at low temperatures.

					<h2>Metalloids</h2>
					<p>
						Some of the elements in the nonmetal group look like metals. One example is silicon. While it can be polished like a metal, silicon is a poor conductor of heat and electricity, and cannot be bent or made into wire. Those elements that have features of both metals and non-metals are called metalloids. There are eight metalloids altogether: boron, silicon, arsenic, germanium, antimony, polonium, astatine and tellurium.
