					I chose to create a website about Chemistry because it was a subject that I enjoyed thoroughly through my high school years. I hope you share this view too. Growing up I was also a big fan of the Harry Potter series (hence my name), so I hoped the idea of magic, potions, etc. provided a fun and interactive time for you.
