				<h1>Separating Blood</h1>
			</article>
			
			<article class="info">
				<aside>
					<p>
						About one million donations of blood are made in Australia each year. Some of the donations are given to people who have lost blood during surgery, accidents or disasters. Blood is also given to people during the treatment of many diseases, including cancer. These people need to be given a regular supply of blood.
					</p>

					<p>
						Blood is a life-giving mixture. It can be separated into four parts: plasma, a clear, yellowish liquid; red blood cells, which carry oxygen; white blood cells, which fight disease; and platelets, which clot blood. Because each part of the blood has a special job to do in our bodies, different problems can be treated with different parts of the blood. In Australia, blood is collected and separated by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service. Separation allows doctors to treat a larger number of patients and save many lives. The blood cells and platelets are separated from blood donations by spinning in a refrigerated centrifuge. Further centrifuging separates the platelets and different types of blood cells.

						Once blood is separated, each part has to be stored differently.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Red blood cells can be stored for 42 days at 2–6 °C.
						</li>
						<li>
							Plasma can be frozen for 12 months at −40 °C.
						</li>
						<li>
							Platelets are stored for 5 days at 20–24 °C. During this time they have to be moved at least every 12 hours, to stop them clumping together. (Platelets seal wounds in our bodies by sticking together.)

			</article>
			
			<article class="info">
				<aside>
					<p>
						The ‘fizz’ in fizzy drinks is the carbon dioxide gas that is dissolved in the flavoured liquid. Carbon dioxide is pumped into bottles or cans at high pressure. The bottles and cans are then sealed to keep the carbon dioxide dissolved in the water. When you open the container, the pressure is reduced and the carbon dioxide bubbles out.
					</p>

					<p>
						Like most substances, fizzy drinks are mixtures of other substances. If you look at the label on a bottle or can of soft drink, you will see that, as well as carbon dioxide, it also contains sugar, food colouring, flavouring and preservative. Preservatives stop the substances in soft drinks from going off. Flavourings are added to make the drink taste more pleasant and food colouring is added to make the drink look more attractive.

					<p>
						All of these substances are dissolved in water. A mixture of one substance dissolved in another is called a solution. The substance that dissolves is called the solute (<em>Click on the cup below to see how this happens</em>). The substance that the solute dissolves in is called the solvent. Solutions in which water is the solvent are called aqueous solutions. Water is a good solvent because many chemicals can dissolve in it. Fizzy soft drinks are aqueous solutions. Substances that dissolve in a liquid are said to be soluble. Those that do not dissolve are said to be insoluble.

			<h2>Distillation</h2>
			<article class="info">
				<aside>
					<p>
						In the laboratory, pure water is produced by a process called distillation. Tap water is poured into the boiling flask (see the diagram above right) and heated to the boiling temperature for water, 100 °C. The water boils, evaporates and becomes steam. The steam travels along the water condenser. The steam inside the condenser is cooled to below 100 °C and condenses to form liquid water. The condenser is kept cool by running cold water through its outer jacket. The pure water collected in the conical flask is called the distillate and can be rightly labelled distilled water. The impurities in the water are left behind in the boiling flask. Distillation can be used to separate pure water from sea water. It can also be used to separate a mixture of two liquids as long as they boil at different temperatures.

			<h2>Evaporation</h2>
			<article class="info">
				<aside>
					<p>
						Pure water can be separated from salty water without boiling it. The salt and other impurities are left behind. The process takes longer, but the energy of the sun can be used to evaporate the water. The solar still shown on the previous page could be used to produce small amounts of pure water from salt water.
					</p>
				</aside>

				<aside>
					<p>
						When evaporation is used to separate pure water from salty water, the salt is left behind as crystals. If it is more important to collect the solute than the solvent, this process of separation is called crystallisation. Table salt is produced by the process of crystallisation, using energy from the sun to evaporate sea water or water from salt lakes.
					</p>
				</aside>

			<h2>Osmosis</h2>
			<article>
				<aside>
					<p>
						In the process of osmosis, water moves through a very thin membrane from an area of low salt concentration to an area of high salt concentration. This continues until the concentration of salt is the same on both sides of the membrane. The membrane has tiny holes that allow water to pass through without the salt. In reverse osmosis, the water is forced under very high pressure to flow through the membrane in the opposite direction.
