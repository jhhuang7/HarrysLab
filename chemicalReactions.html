			</article>
			
			<article class="info">
				<aside>
					<h2>Acids</h2>
					<p>
						Acids are corrosive substances. That means they react with solid substances, ‘eating’ them away. Acids have a sour taste — in fact, the word ‘acid’ comes from a Latin word meaning sour. Some acids, such as the sulfuric acid used in car batteries, are dangerously corrosive. The acids in ant stings and bee stings cause pain. Others, such as the acids in fruits and vinegar, are safe — even pleasant — to taste.
					</p>
				</aside>

				<aside>
					<h2>Bases</h2>
					<p>
						Bases have a bitter taste and feel slippery or soapy to touch. Some bases are very corrosive, especially caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). Caustic soda will break down fat, hair and vegetable matter and is the main ingredient in drain cleaners. Other bases are used in soap, shampoo, toothpaste, dishwashing liquid and cloudy ammonia as cleaning agents. Bases that can be dissolved in water are called alkalis.
					</p>
				</aside>

			<h2>The pH scale</h2>
			<article class="info">
				<aside>
					<p>
						You can describe how acidic or basic a substance is by using the numbers on the pH scale. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. Low pH numbers (less than pH 7) mean that substances are acidic. High pH numbers (more than pH 7) mean that substances are basic. If a substance has a pH of 7, it is said to be neutral — neither acidic nor basic.
					</p>
					<p>
						Acids and bases can be graded from strong to weak. For example, a strong acid has a very low pH (pH 0 or 1) and a strong base has a very high pH (pH 13 or 14). When an acid and a base react with each other, the products include water and a salt. Such a reaction is called a neutralisation reaction.

                <h1>Endothermic or Exothermic?</h1>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<aside>
					<p>
						The energy released comes from the rearrangement of atoms. There is less energy stored in the chemical bonds in the products than there was in the reactants. Chemical reactions that release energy are called exothermic reactions. Chemical reactions in which energy is absorbed from the surroundings are called endothermic reactions. There is more energy ‘stored’ in the chemical bonds of the products than there was in the reactants.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether energy is absorbed or released during a chemical reaction can be observed by comparing the temperature of the substances before the reaction with their temperature after the reaction.

						Portable hand warmers, commonly used by skiers and campers, become hot when shaken due to an exothermic chemical reaction in which energy is released to the surroundings. One type of hand warmer contains iron, water, salt and sawdust. When the contents of the packet are shaken quickly, the powdered iron reacts with oxygen to form iron oxide. During this chemical reaction, some of the chemical energy of the substances is transformed into heat energy which is transferred to the hands, increasing their temperature.

						Athletes use instant icepacks to treat injuries. The icepack may consist of a plastic bag containing ammonium nitrate or ammonium chloride powder and an inner bag of water. Squeezing the bag breaks the weaker inner bag and immediately causes the powder to dissolve in the water. The chemical process that takes place absorbs energy from the injured area, thus lowering its temperature. It is therefore an endothermic chemical process.

				<h1>Combustion reactions</h1>
			</article>

			<article class="info">
				<aside>
					<p>
						Combustion reactions are those in which a substance reacts with oxygen and heat is released. Burning is a combustion reaction that produces a flame. The substance that reacts with oxygen in a combustion reaction is called a fuel. The chemical word equation for the combustion of octane is: octane + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fossil fuels such as natural gas, petrol and coal have formed from the remains of living things. They are compounds of hydrogen and carbon called hydrocarbons. The products of the combustion of fossil fuels always include carbon dioxide and water. Because of impurities in fossil fuels, these are not the only products of their combustion. In some cases various dangerous gases, including carbon monoxide, are also produced.
					</p>
					<p>
						The fuel used in jet aircraft is kerosene, which is obtained from crude oil. Like the octane in cars, the vapour of this fossil fuel reacts with oxygen. An electrical spark is used to start the reaction. The chemical word equation for the combustion of kerosene in a jet engine is: kerosene + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water.
					</p>
					<p>
						A chemical reaction called respiration takes place in every cell of your body. Respiration is a slow combustion reaction. The energy required by your body is released when the fuel, glucose from your digested food, reacts with oxygen from the air that you breathe. The products of respiration are carbon dioxide and water. The chemical word equation for respiration is: glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water.
